# Neural Network Model for Predicting Startup Success

This is a binary classification model that uses a deep neural network to predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will become successful businesses.

## Technologies

This project utilizes python 3.7 along with the following packages:

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 

[Keras](https://keras.io/)

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

This project has been constructed in a [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) notebook entitled `venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb`.

## Installation Guide

1. Make sure you are using python version 3.7 or greater by typing the following:

`python -V`

2. Confirm that the packages are installed by using the following code lines:

`pip install tensorflow`

`pip install pandas`

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install jupyterlab`
